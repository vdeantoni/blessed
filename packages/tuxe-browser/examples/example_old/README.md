## How It Works

The playground uses **xterm.js** to render the terminal in the browser, and **@tuxe/browser** provides the runtime adapter that makes @tuxe/core work in the browser environment.

All the blessed/tuxe widgets work exactly the same in the browser as they would in a Node.js terminal!

## Development

Edit `examples.js` to add new examples. Each example is a string of JavaScript code that gets evaluated in the browser with access to:
- `blessed` - The tuxe/core library
- `screen` - Pre-configured Screen instance

The code editor supports:
- Syntax highlighting (via textarea)
- Tab key (inserts 2 spaces)
- Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to run code

## Tips

1. **Select from dropdown** - Choose "🎨 Full Interactive Demo" to see all features
2. **Use arrow keys** - Navigate through the widget list
3. **Press Enter** - Activate the selected demo
4. **Click buttons** - Mouse support is fully functional
5. **Watch the log** - Right panel shows all activity in real-time
6. **Press q or Esc** - Clear the terminal

Enjoy exploring @tuxe/core in the browser! 🎉
