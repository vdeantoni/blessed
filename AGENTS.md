# Agent Instructions for `blessed` Modernization

Welcome, agent! This document outlines the vision, roadmap, and guidelines for modernizing the `blessed` library. Your primary goal is to assist in transforming this project into a modern, robust, and high-performance TUI toolkit.

## 1. Project Vision

The core vision for this fork of `blessed` is to evolve it into a state-of-the-art library for building terminal applications. This involves several key objectives:

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Establish a robust testing framework (e.g., Vitest) and achieve high test coverage BEFORE any code changes to ensure we don't break existing functionality.
- **Performance Baseline:** Establish performance benchmarks to measure impact of all changes throughout modernization.
- **Enhance Code Quality:** Refactor the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript incrementally, introducing strict typing and best practices to reduce bugs and improve clarity.
- **Modernize the Toolchain:** Replace the legacy build and development process with modern tools like **TypeScript**, **tsup/esbuild**, and **Prettier** to improve developer experience, code quality, and maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profile the library to identify and address performance bottlenecks, ensuring `blessed` remains a high-performance TUI solution.
- **Future: Integrate `blessed-contrib`:** (Post-core modernization) Incorporate popular widgets from `blessed-contrib`, providing a richer set of components out of the box.

## 2. Core Principles

### Safety First
- **No code changes before test coverage**: We will not touch production code until we have comprehensive tests in place
- **Tests as safety net**: All conversions and refactoring must keep tests green
- **Incremental over big-bang**: Prefer small, safe changes over large risky rewrites

### Measure Everything
- **Establish baselines**: Document current performance before making changes
- **Track regressions**: Run benchmarks after every significant change
- **Coverage metrics**: Track test coverage and aim for concrete targets

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
This must be decided in Phase 0 before proceeding:
- **Option A (Conservative)**: Maintain 100% backward compatibility, release as v1.2.x
- **Option B (Pragmatic)**: Allow minimal breaking changes with clear migration path, release as v2.0.0
- **Option C (Aggressive)**: Modernize API significantly, provide compatibility layer, release as v2.0.0

**Recommendation**: Option B - allows necessary improvements while respecting existing users.

## 3. Modernization Roadmap

This roadmap is divided into phases to provide a structured, safe approach to the modernization effort.

### **Phase 0: Analysis & Critical Decisions**

- **Goal:** Make critical decisions and document current state before any changes.
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Duration:** 1 week

| Task | Description | Complexity |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **0.1: Decide Compatibility Strategy** | Choose Option A, B, or C from above. Document decision and implications. | Low |
| **0.2: Document Current API Surface** | Create comprehensive API documentation of all public methods/properties for compatibility checking. | Medium |
| **0.3: Audit Dependencies** | Review and document all dependencies, identify outdated ones, plan updates. | Low |
| **0.4: Document Known Issues** | Catalog known bugs and quirks - decide which to preserve vs fix. | Low |
| **0.5: Choose Build Tooling** | Evaluate options (tsup, esbuild, rollup). **Recommendation**: tsup (better for Node.js libraries than Vite). | Low |
| **0.6: Set Minimum Node.js Version** | Current is ">= 0.8.0" - propose modern minimum (14.x? 16.x? 18.x?). | Low |
| **0.7: Terminal Compatibility Matrix** | Document which terminals are officially supported and tested. | Medium |

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Compatibility strategy documented and agreed upon
- [ ] Current API surface fully documented

  - Root cause: npm fails to install platform-specific binaries for rollup
  - Workaround attempted: Switching to pnpm with frozen-lockfile
  - Status: pnpm-lock.yaml generated, workflow updated to use pnpm
  - Alternative considered: Removing package-lock.json (defeats purpose of lock file)
- ‚è≥ **Package manager decision pending**: pnpm vs npm
  - pnpm handles optional dependencies more reliably
  - Both lock files currently present (package-lock.json + pnpm-lock.yaml)
  - Recommendation: Commit to pnpm and remove package-lock.json

## 4. Testing Strategy for Terminal UI Library

### Challenge
Traditional testing is difficult for libraries that manipulate terminal I/O directly.

### Approach

**Layer 1: Pure Function Testing**
- Helpers, color utilities, unicode calculations
- 100% coverage achievable
- Standard unit tests

**Layer 2: Widget Logic Testing**
- Test with mocked screen/program
- Mock terminal dimensions, capabilities
- Assert against mock output buffers
- 70-80% coverage target

**Layer 3: Integration Testing**
- Convert all examples to integration tests
- Run against fully mocked terminal
- Verify complete user flows work
- 100% of examples must pass

**Layer 4: Visual/Snapshot Testing (Optional)**
- Capture screen buffer output as strings
- Compare against known-good snapshots
- Useful for catching visual regressions

### Mock Strategy

```javascript
// Example mock approach
const mockProgram = {
  cols: 80,
  rows: 24,
  output: new MockWriteStream(),
  // Mock all terminal operations
  _write: function(data) { this.output.write(data); },
  // ... etc
};

const screen = blessed.screen({
  program: mockProgram
});

// Test assertions
expect(mockProgram.output.toString()).toContain('expected output');
```

## 5. Performance Metrics & Targets

### Baseline Metrics (To Be Established in Phase 1)
- Document current performance across all benchmarks
- Establish acceptable ranges for each metric

### Target Improvements
- Rendering: No regression, aim for 10-20% improvement
- Memory: Reduce footprint for large datasets by 15%+
- Event processing: Maintain sub-millisecond latency
- Cold start: Library import time < 100ms

### Continuous Monitoring
- CI runs benchmarks on every PR
- Alert on regressions > 10%
- Track trends over time

---

## 6. Decision Log

This section tracks key decisions made during modernization.

### Phase 0 Decisions (To Be Made)
- [ ] **Compatibility Strategy**: Option A / B / C?
- [ ] **Minimum Node.js Version**: 14.x / 16.x / 18.x / 20.x?
- [ ] **Build Tool**: tsup / esbuild / rollup?
- [ ] **Breaking Changes Policy**: Document what's allowed
- [ ] **Module Format**: CommonJS only / ESM only / Both?
- [ ] **Terminal Support**: Which terminals officially supported?

### Rationale for Test-First Approach
Testing before conversion protects against regressions in a complex, low-level library where bugs can be subtle and hard to detect. With 21K+ lines of intricate terminal manipulation code, comprehensive test coverage is non-negotiable.

### Rationale for Incremental Conversion
Converting 21K LOC in one shot is extremely risky. Incremental conversion with `allowJs: true` allows:
- Keeping the build working throughout
- Running tests continuously
- Catching issues early and often
- Allowing rollback if needed
- Maintaining contributor velocity

### Rationale for Build Tool Choice
Vite is optimized for web applications with HMR and dev servers. For a Node.js library:
- **tsup**: Best choice - built for libraries, simple config, good output
- **esbuild**: Fast, flexible, good for complex needs
- **rollup**: Traditional choice, very flexible
- ~~**Vite**: Not ideal for Node.js library use case~~

## 7. Questions & Answers

### How long will this take?
- Phase 0: 1 week
- Phase 1: 3-4 weeks (most critical)
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 6-8 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- **Total: ~4-5 months** for core modernization

### Can we skip testing and go straight to TypeScript?
**No.** This is the most critical mistake to avoid. Without tests:
- You won't know what you broke
- Regressions will be discovered by users
- Rollback is difficult
- Confidence in changes is low

### What if tests are hard to write?
Start with easy wins (helpers, utilities). Build test infrastructure gradually. Some parts (program.js, tput.js) may never have high unit test coverage - that's okay if integration tests cover them.

### Should we maintain 100% backward compatibility?
Recommend Option B: Allow minimal, well-documented breaking changes for significant improvements. Most users can adapt with a good migration guide.

### What about blessed-contrib?
Deal with it in Phase 6, after core modernization is complete and stable. Don't let it scope creep into the core effort.
