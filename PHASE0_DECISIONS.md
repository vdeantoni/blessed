# Phase 0: Analysis & Critical Decisions

This document tracks all decisions made during Phase 0 of the blessed modernization effort.

## Status: In Progress

---

## 0.3: Dependencies Audit ‚úÖ

### Current State
- **Runtime Dependencies**: None (blessed is dependency-free!)
- **Dev Dependencies**: None listed in package.json
- **Optional Dependencies**: None

### Analysis
This is excellent - blessed is a pure Node.js library with no external dependencies. This significantly simplifies the modernization effort.

### Action Items
- Add modern dev dependencies during Phase 1 (Vitest, TypeScript, etc.)
- Keep runtime dependency-free if possible

---

## 0.6: Minimum Node.js Version

### Current State
- **Current requirement**: `">= 0.8.0"` (released June 2012!)
- **Your Node version**: v24.9.0

### Analysis
Node.js 0.8.0 is extremely outdated. Modern tooling requires much newer versions:
- **Node.js 14.x**: EOL April 2023
- **Node.js 16.x**: EOL September 2023
- **Node.js 18.x**: LTS until April 2025
- **Node.js 20.x**: LTS until April 2026
- **Node.js 22.x**: Current (became LTS October 2024)

### Recommendation
**Minimum: Node.js 18.x** (currently in LTS)

**Rationale:**
- Still has active LTS support until April 2025
- Supports all modern JavaScript features we need
- Compatible with TypeScript, Vitest, and modern tooling
- Balances modernity with reasonable backward compatibility
- Most production environments have migrated to 18+ by now

### ‚úÖ DECISION: Node.js 22.x

**Approved by maintainer**

**Rationale:**
- Node.js 22.x is the current LTS (as of October 2024)
- LTS support until April 2027 (longer runway)
- Access to latest JavaScript features
- Future-proofs the library for longer
- Modern tooling fully supports it

---

## 0.5: Build Tooling

### Options Evaluated

#### Option 1: tsup (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Purpose-built for libraries, simple config, excellent DX, handles CJS/ESM/types
- **Cons**: Less flexible than raw esbuild/rollup
- **Best for**: Our use case (Node.js library modernization)

#### Option 2: esbuild
- **Pros**: Extremely fast, flexible, widely adopted
- **Cons**: More configuration needed, need separate dts bundler
- **Best for**: Complex build requirements

#### Option 3: rollup
- **Pros**: Battle-tested, excellent plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Slower than esbuild/tsup, more configuration
- **Best for**: Traditional projects with complex needs

#### ~~Option 4: Vite~~ (Not Recommended)
- **Cons**: Optimized for web apps with HMR, overkill for library
- **Not suited** for Node.js library use case

### Recommendation
**Use tsup** (with caveat)

**Rationale:**
- Perfect for TypeScript library modernization
- Single command to output CJS, ESM, and type definitions
- Minimal configuration required
- Based on esbuild (fast) but library-optimized
- Great developer experience

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Maintenance Status**
- tsup appears to be unmaintained (last major updates 2023)
- Original maintainer less active
- However: It's built on esbuild, which IS actively maintained
- Still works well, but future updates uncertain

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- If tsup becomes problematic, migration to raw esbuild is straightforward
- Keep build config simple to ease future migration
- Monitor tsup's status and be ready to switch if needed

### ‚úÖ DECISION: tsup (with migration plan)

**Approved by maintainer with awareness of maintenance concerns**

**Plan:**
- Use tsup for simplicity now
- Keep build config minimal and portable
- Have esbuild migration plan ready if tsup fails
- Worst case: tsup still works, we just fork or migrate later

---

## 0.1: Compatibility Strategy

### ‚úÖ DECISION: Two-Track Strategy

**Approved by maintainer**

This modernization will follow a **two-track versioning strategy** that serves both existing and new users:

---

### Track 1: v1.x - Backward Compatible (v0.0.1 ‚Üí v1.0.0)

**Philosophy:** 100% backward compatibility with original blessed

**Target Users:**
- Existing applications that want improvements without code changes
- Users who can't afford migration time
- Production apps requiring stability

**Strategy:**
- Start at v0.0.1 (pre-release)
- Work towards stable v1.0.0
- TypeScript conversion with **Option A: Conservative**
- Zero breaking changes to public API
- All existing blessed code works unchanged
- Only additions and internal improvements

**What v1.x Provides:**
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types and definitions
- ‚úÖ Modern build system (ESM + CJS)
- ‚úÖ Better documentation
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations (preserving behavior)
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes (non-breaking)
- ‚úÖ New features (additive only)
- ‚ùå No API changes
- ‚ùå No breaking improvements

**Release Path:**
```
Original blessed 0.1.81
  ‚Üì
v0.1.82 (our fork start)
  ‚Üì
v0.2.x, v0.3.x, etc. (development releases during modernization)
  ‚Üì
v1.0.0 (stable, fully modernized, backward compatible)
  ‚Üì
v1.x.x (minor improvements, patches)
```

---

### Track 2: v2.x+ - Modern & Improved (Future)

**Philosophy:** Clean, modern API for new development

**Target Users:**
- New applications being built
- Existing users willing to migrate
- Those who want best-in-class API

**Strategy:**
- After v1.0.0 is stable
- **Option B/C: Pragmatic to Aggressive** changes allowed
- Fix API quirks and inconsistencies
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- Breaking changes are okay (with migration path)

**What v2.x+ Will Provide:**
- ‚úÖ All v1.x improvements
- ‚úÖ Fixed API inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Better TypeScript ergonomics
- ‚úÖ Modern patterns (classes, async, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Cleaner architecture
- ‚úÖ Migration guides
- ‚úÖ Codemods (automated migration tools)
- ‚úÖ Deprecation warnings in v1.x preparing for v2

**Migration Support:**
```javascript
// v1.x - will work forever
const blessed = require('blessed');
var screen = blessed.screen({ smartCSR: true });

// v2.x - improved API
import { Screen } from 'blessed';
const screen = new Screen({ smartCSR: true });

// Codemod tool will automate migration:
npx blessed-migrate v1-to-v2 ./src
```

### Versioning Timeline

```
Phase 1-3: Build v1.0.0 (Backward Compatible)
‚îú‚îÄ v0.1.0 ‚Üí v0.5.0: TypeScript conversion
‚îú‚îÄ v0.6.0 ‚Üí v0.9.0: Testing, optimization
‚îî‚îÄ v1.0.0: Stable release (100% compatible with original blessed)

Phase 4+: Maintain v1.x + Plan v2.0.0
‚îú‚îÄ v1.1.x, v1.2.x: Minor improvements, backports
‚îî‚îÄ v2.0.0: Modern API (breaking changes, migration guides)

Future: v3.x, v4.x, etc.
‚îî‚îÄ Continued evolution with proper migration paths
```

---

### Key Policies

**For v1.x (Current Focus):**
- ‚ùå No breaking changes, ever
- ‚ùå Can't remove duplicate methods
- ‚ùå Can't fix confusing APIs
- ‚úÖ Can add new features
- ‚úÖ Can improve types (must match existing behavior)
- ‚úÖ Can optimize internally
- ‚úÖ Can add deprecation warnings (for v2 prep)

**For v2.x+ (Future):**
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes allowed
- ‚úÖ Fix API inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Modern patterns
- ‚úÖ Must provide migration guide
- ‚úÖ Should provide codemods
- ‚úÖ Deprecations in v1.x should prepare users

---

### This Strategy Combines Best Of:
- **Option A** (Conservative) for v1.x
- **Option B/C** (Pragmatic/Aggressive) for v2.x+
- **Option D** (Gradual Deprecation) between versions
- **Option E** (Dual API) - v1 and v2 coexist

**Benefits:**
- Existing users never forced to migrate
- New users get modern API
- Clear path for both stability and innovation
- Ecosystem can evolve without breaking existing apps
